A simple drag-and-drop system in Unity where:
 
- Two Rectangles and a polygon: The user can drag and drop a large rectangle (representing a "greenhouse"), a smaller rectangle (representing a "raised bed"), and a polygon (representing a tree) into a predefined 2D layout.
- Nested Object Movement: Once the smaller rectangle is placed inside the larger one, the user can move the larger rectangle, and the smaller rectangle should follow it as a nested object.
- Rotation Mechanism: The user should be able to rotate the larger rectangle, and the smaller rectangle inside should rotate along with it, maintaining its relative position.
- Polygon Constraints: The polygon cannot overlap with the large rectangle.
